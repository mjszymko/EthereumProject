Need to write solidity code to be accessed in a Javascript project, we need some way to 
rapidly test contracts (without doing a lot of button pressing in Remix), and finally need
a way to deploy our contracts to a public network

TODO
-set up Solidity compiler to build the contracts
-set up Mocha test runniner to test Solidity code
-set up a deploy script to compile and deploy the contract
